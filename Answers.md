## Chapter One
**Reading Passage**
This work presents a series of studies on recent methods of characterization and of determinable structures of macromolecular compounds. It is the collective work of several specialists and constitues a volume particuliarly important.  ... The author begins by a study on the microactivities and on the methods of determination of the stereoregularities in solid state and in solution.  ... Two important chapters treat the diffusion of X rays ar short angles and the diffraction of elections. Nuclear magnetic resonance is the subject of one chapter, with its utilization for the determination of the configuration and of the strcuture of macromolecular chains. Differential thermical analysis is then developed at length. An abundant bibligraphy completes each chapter. A table of contents finishes the work, which will certainly be received with much favor.
